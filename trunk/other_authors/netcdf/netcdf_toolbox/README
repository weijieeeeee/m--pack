$Name: netcdf_toolbox-1_0_10 $

After unpacking the netcdf toolbox, you should adjust your matlab path
as follows

addpath /path/to/this/directory/netcdf -end
addpath /path/to/this/directory/netcdf/nctype -end
addpath /path/to/this/directory/netcdf/ncutility -end

Yes, that's all you have to do, no more unbundling from within matlab.
The netcdf toolbox requires mexnc in order to work, and mexnc should
precede the netcdf_toolbox in your path.

If you wish to automatically scale your data and have fill values replaced
by NaNs, you should define a global structure called "nctbx_options"
as follows:


	>> global nctbx_options;
	>> nctbx_options.theAutoscale = 1;
	>> nctbx_options.theAutoNaN = 1;

You can place this code in your startup.m if you don't want to continually
have to do this upon starting matlab.

There is a minor namespace clash with the SNCTOOLS toolbox in that both
have an m-file called "nc2mat.m".
