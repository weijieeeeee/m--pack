SNCTOOLS
=======================================================================

Of all the routines in this m-file collection, the most useful (in my
humble opinion) are
	
	1. nc_varget    - reads a netcdf variable
	2. nc_varput    - writes to a netcdf variable
	3. nc_attget    - reads a netcdf attribute
	4. nc_attput    - writes a netcdf attribute
	5. nc_dump      - prints netcdf metadata
	6. nc_padheader - pads header section of large netCDF files

There is a subdirectory called "tests" which has routines that test
the m-files of SNCTOOLS.  You really don't need to worry about this
unless you are convinced that there is something wrong with one of
the m-files.  In that case, you can run the test suite by changing
directories into "tests" and running "test_snctools" from the matlab
command line.


KNOWN ISSUES
=======================================================================

The test suite will fail when used with opendap builds of mexnc.  I 
believe the problem is that a netcdf file is not being properly closed
somewhere in the test suite, but I haven't tracked it down yet.

There will be varying degrees of difficulty in transitioning SNCTOOLS
to work with upcoming builds of mexnc/netcdf-4 (I won't even attempt
it with the netcdf toolbox).  Some m-files, like nc_varget, nc_varput,
nc_attget, nc_attput, and nc_dump will be getting a lot more attention
from me than others in this matter.
