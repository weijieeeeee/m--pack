well, it looks like the last seagrid version (Jul-2003) is not working under Linux
there is the error when clicking on the figure:

  ## No valid event-handler for "ps" class: "windowbuttondownfcn" (figure = 1)

so, it i include here a previous version (Oct-2002) that is used under Linux

If you know what is happening please tell me: martinho@fis.ua.pt
