<b>misc</b>
<p>
Things you should know:
<p> when using ROMS history file as stations file, because of C-grid, size of 
  u, v and rho are different<br>
so last line and column can not be used; besides, u and v are not at same position... interpolation should be done <br>
this is not done yet cos my main aim is to use stations file!
<p>
SpectrHA was created in Linux MATLAB 6. In other versions some problems may occur... warning messages, ugly legends and labels, etc 
<p>
A log file is created when you run spectrha, use logname as argument. Without arguments, a default logname is created (see configuration)
